# Building this portfolio

In this post, I'll walk you through how I built this macOS-inspired portfolio website.

## Technologies used

- **Next.js 15** - For the React framework
- **Tailwind CSS** - For styling
- **TypeScript** - For type safety
- **Nextra** - For the blog functionality

## Key features

### Interactive desktop environment
The main page simulates a macOS desktop with:
- Draggable windows
- Resizable windows
- Dock with app icons
- Menu bar

### Responsive design
The site works great on both desktop and mobile devices.

## Challenges faced

One of the biggest challenges was implementing the window management system with proper drag and resize functionality while maintaining good performance.
